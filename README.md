Press b to skip Youtube ads. Also useful for in-video sponsored content; pressing b toggles 10x speed to get through these quickly. \n

To install:\n
-Follow the instructions here: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/development-basics/#load-unpacked

To use:
-Press the 'b' key on your keyboard when an ad pops up\n
-For in-video ads, press b when they start to speed up and b when they stop to slow back down\n\n


This is meant to be as simple as possible to encourage trust and hacking. All of the code is in a single, 42 line JS file. \n

Some possible areas to improve:\n
-Auto-sensing ads to eliminate the requirement for key presses (YouTube has made this much harder than in the past)\n
-Storing popular skips for different videos and mapping a setting or hotkey to auto-skip sponsored content based on others' skips
